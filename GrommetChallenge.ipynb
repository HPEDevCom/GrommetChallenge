    "# Welcome to the DISCOVER Hack Shack Grommet Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "## Challenge prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend you attend the following Discover Hack Shack workshops before attempting this challenge:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Hack Shack Workshop: Git 101](../../WKSHP-GIT101/0-ReadmeFirst.ipynb)\n",
    "2. [Hack Shack Workshop: Streamline app development with open source Grommet](../../WKSHP-Grommet/0-ReadmeFirst.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, make sure you leverage the notebooks provided in your Jupyter account environment as reference material.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Please note, your account session will only be allocated for a 4-hour time slot, so make sure you register only when you have enough time available to take the challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Challenge description\n",
    "\n",
    "A new mission awaits! In this challenge, you will take on a UX designer persona and show your creative side using Grommet to design your own little web app UI. You will start with the Grommet Designer, generate code from your design, push that code to GitHub, and finally deploy the app on Netlify. Beginner through expert designers and developers are all welcome. This challenge is all about unleashing your creativity!\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 1: Build a sample front-end application\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step to accomplish this challenge is to create a web front-end application, and for this we would like you to use Grommet Designer. Keep it simple yet slick, show your design prowess. The [Hack Shack Workshop: Streamline app development with open source Grommet](../WKSHP-Grommet/1-WKSHP-Introduction.ipynb) is your best point of reference  for this step, if you need help.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quiz question 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the URL of the Grommet Designer?"

    "# Step 2: Run your web application locally\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step of the challenge is to make this application work locally on your laptop. The Grommet Designer online instructions and the [Lab 3 of the Grommet Workshop](../WKSHP-Grommet/3-WKSHP-PrepareEnvironment.ipynb) are your best source of information for accomplishing this. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 3: Share your application in GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step, you will use the local version of your application to create a local git repo and then upload it into your GitHub account. The [Hack Shack Workshop: Git 101](../WKSHP-GIT101/1-WKSHP-GIT-Basics.ipynb) and [the last part of Lab 3 of the Grommet Workshop](../WKSHP-Grommet/3-WKSHP-PrepareEnvironment.ipynb) are your best sources of information for accomplishing this.\n",

    "\n",
    "This is the final step of your challenge. We will ask you to use [Netlifly](https://netlifly.com) to host your application so we can judge it. For this you will need to setup an account on [Netlifly](https://netlifly.com) (this is free) and a CI/CD configuration so that [Netlifly](https://netlifly.com) automatically builds your web site from your GitHub repo created in Step 3. Use [Lab4 of the Grommet Workshop](../WKSHP-Grommet/4-WKSHP-DeploytoNetlify.ipynb) for details on how to accomplish this. Once this is all in place, not only will your application be up and running (try changing the domain name to obtain a friendly URL), but it will automatically update everytime you commit changes to it in GitHub. \n",

    "\n",
    "- Step 1: Commit changes in your Jupyter environment  (again using your Launcher terminal window)\n",
    "- Step 2: Push changes to your repo  (still using your Launcher terminal window)\n",
    "- Step 3: Open a Pull Request (PR) on our original repo. Make sure you provide an email in the description of the PR so we can contact you if your submission has been chosen. (This step is done from your GitHub account).\n",
    "\n",
    "![Open PR](Pictures/NewPullRequest.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "You should submit your response within the 4-hour time slot. We will reset all the Jupyter accounts right after the time is up, so make sure you have at least committed and pushed your changes back to your repo prior to that. You will then have more time to submit your PR.\n",

    "\n",
    "Don't hesitate to refer back to the notebooks in your Jupyter accounts for help in answering questions that come up in the challenge. We have set up a Slack channel in the HPE DEV Slack Workspace. Feel free to [join the workspace](https://slack.hpedev.io/) then [start asking questions there](https://hpedev.slack.com/archives/C015CLE2QTT). We will be around to help you.\n",
